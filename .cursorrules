# Cursor Rules for Cleanbox Project

## 🚀 **How We Work Together**

### **Before Writing Code**
1. **Always discuss the approach first** - Don't assume what the user wants
2. **Ask clarifying questions** - Understand the scope and requirements
3. **Check existing code** - Look at how similar functionality is implemented
4. **Consider the user's preferences** - They prefer atomic commits and clean code

### **Communication Style**
- **Ask before implementing** - Discuss approach, don't just write code
- **Explain your reasoning** - Help the user understand your decisions
- **Admit mistakes** - If you make an error, acknowledge and fix it
- **Learn from feedback** - Pay attention to user preferences and adjust
- **Use factual, objective language** - Focus on what changed and why, not subjective judgements
- **Avoid value judgements** - Don't use phrases like "better", "improved", "transforms", "well-organized", etc.
- **No unnecessary commentary** - Don't add lines like "All tests passing" or subjective assessments
- **Stick to facts** - Describe the changes made, files affected, and technical reasons
- **Avoid AI-generated language patterns** - Don't use phrases like "X files modified", "Y additions, Z deletions", or other statistical summaries that sound robotic

### **Development Principles**
- **Atomic commits** - Each commit should contain one logical change
- **Conventional commit messages** - Use `feat:`, `fix:`, `style:`, `docs:` prefixes
- **Never use `git add .`** - Be specific about what files to commit
- **Group related changes** - Multiple files for same feature in one commit
- **Leverage existing code** - Don't recreate what already exists
- **Follow established patterns** - Look at how similar features are implemented
- **Minimal changes** - Make the smallest change that accomplishes the goal
- **No over-engineering** - Don't add features unless specifically requested

### **Common Pitfalls to Avoid**
- **Over-engineering** - Don't add features beyond what's requested
- **Ignoring existing patterns** - Check how similar functionality works
- **Poor error handling** - Let existing error handling do its job
- **Wrong file paths** - Use correct relative paths from script locations
- **Code without understanding** - This is the #1 mistake that leads to rework

### **When in Doubt**
1. **Ask questions** - Clarify requirements and approach
2. **Show examples** - Demonstrate what you're thinking before implementing
3. **Start small** - Begin with minimal implementation and iterate
4. **Check existing code** - Look for patterns and examples in the codebase

## 📚 **Essential Reading Order**
1. **`.cursorrules`** - Workflow, communication style, and development principles (this file)
2. **`CONTEXT.md`** - Project overview, technical details, and current status
3. **`SESSION_LOG.md`** - Recent session documentation and learnings
4. **`TODO.md`** - Current priorities and completed features

Remember: **Discuss first, implement second, and always follow the user's preferences for code organization and style.**
