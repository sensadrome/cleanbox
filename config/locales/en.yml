    analysis:
      starting: |
        📁 Analyzing your email folders...

        I'll examine each folder to understand how you organize your emails.
        This helps Cleanbox learn what to do with new incoming emails:

        • WHITELIST folders: Emails from these senders stay in your inbox
          (like Family, Work, Friends - emails you want to see immediately)

        • LIST folders: Emails from these senders get moved to folders
          (like Newsletters, Shopping, Social media - emails you can read later)

        • System folders: Calendar, Drafts, etc. are automatically skipped

        For each folder, I'll show you my analysis and ask for confirmation.

    domain_mappings:
      explanation: |
        Sometimes emails come from addresses that don't match your existing folders.
        For example, you might have a 'GitHub' folder, but get emails from:
          • issue.12345.project@github.com
          • noreply@githubusercontent.com

        Domain mappings tell Cleanbox: 'When you see emails from these domains,
        put them in this folder, even if the sender address looks different.'
