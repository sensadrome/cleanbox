        Before we can analyze your email, we need to set up authentication.
        What would you like to do?
          1. Set up authentication now (recommended)
          2. Skip authentication setup (you can run './cleanbox auth setup' later)

    analysis:
      starting: |
        📁 Analyzing your email folders...

        I'll examine each folder to understand how you organize your emails.
        This helps Cleanbox learn what to do with new incoming emails:

        • WHITELIST folders: Emails from these senders stay in your inbox
          (like Family, Work, Friends - emails you want to see immediately)

        • LIST folders: Emails from these senders get moved to folders
          (like Newsletters, Shopping, Social media - emails you can read later)

        • System folders: Calendar, Drafts, etc. are automatically skipped

        For each folder, I'll show you my analysis and ask for confirmation.

    domain_mappings:
      explanation: |
        Sometimes emails come from addresses that don't match your existing folders.
        For example, you might have a 'GitHub' folder, but get emails from:
          • issue.12345.project@github.com
          • noreply@githubusercontent.com

        Domain mappings tell Cleanbox: 'When you see emails from these domains,
        put them in this folder, even if the sender address looks different.'
